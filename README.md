### 📌 **Additional Explanation**
1️⃣ **`GROQ_API_KEY`**  
   - Required to interact with the **Groq API**.  
   - You must obtain an API key and store it here before running Retrospect.  

2️⃣ **`MODEL_ID`**  
   - Specifies which language model will be used for text analysis.  
   - **Example:** `llama3-70b-8192` is an optimized AI model for text understanding.  

3️⃣ **`MAX_CHUNKS`**  
   - Controls the maximum number of text chunks that will be analyzed per document.  
   - A higher value allows more content to be analyzed but increases processing time.  

4️⃣ **`CHUNK_SIZE`**  
   - Defines the number of characters in each chunk when splitting large files.  
   - Choosing an appropriate size ensures that language models do not exceed their processing limits.  

5️⃣ **`CHUNK_OVERLAP`**  
   - Allows some overlap between chunks to improve context continuity.  
   - **Example:** If set to `500`, each chunk will include the last 500 characters of the previous one.
