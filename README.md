## 🛠️ Environment Variables (`.env.template`)

Retrospect uses environment variables to configure various aspects of its operation. Below is a breakdown of their purposes and expected values:

| Variable | Description | Default Value / Example |
|----------|------------|------------------------|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | API Key for authenticating requests to the **Groq** API. Used for sensitive data analysis. | `your_api_key_here` |
| `MODEL_ID` | Identifier of the language model used for text processing. | `llama3-70b-8192` |
| `MAX_CHUNKS` | Maximum number of text chunks into which a large file will be split before analysis. | `3` |
| `CHUNK_SIZE` | Size (in characters) of each text chunk when splitting files for analysis. | `4500` |
| `CHUNK_OVERLAP` | Number of overlapping characters between chunks to maintain context. | `0` |

### 📌 **Additional Explanation**
1️⃣ **`GROQ_API_KEY`**  
   - Required to interact with the **Groq API**.  
   - You must obtain an API key and store it here before running Retrospect.  

2️⃣ **`MODEL_ID`**  
   - Specifies which language model will be used for text analysis.  
   - **Example:** `llama3-70b-8192` is an optimized AI model for text understanding.  

3️⃣ **`MAX_CHUNKS`**  
   - Controls the maximum number of text chunks that will be analyzed per document.  
   - A higher value allows more content to be analyzed but increases processing time.  

4️⃣ **`CHUNK_SIZE`**  
   - Defines the number of characters in each chunk when splitting large files.  
   - Choosing an appropriate size ensures that language models do not exceed their processing limits.  

5️⃣ **`CHUNK_OVERLAP`**  
   - Allows some overlap between chunks to improve context continuity.  
   - **Example:** If set to `500`, each chunk will include the last 500 characters of the previous one.

## 🖥️ **Using the CLI for Retrospect**

Retrospect provides a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** to streamline the process of **historical web reconnaissance** and **security analysis**. The CLI allows you to easily query archived web snapshots, extract data, and perform security analysis to identify vulnerabilities from the past that could still be a risk today.

### **CLI Command Options**

Below is a table explaining the available options when using the Retrospect CLI:

| Option                             | Description                                                                                                 | Default Value               |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `--url <TARGET_URL>`               | **Required**: The target URL to analyze. For example: `https://example.com`.                               | N/A                         |
| `--user_agent <USER_AGENT>`        | **Optional**: The User-Agent string for HTTP requests. If not provided, the default User-Agent is used.    | Default User-Agent          |
